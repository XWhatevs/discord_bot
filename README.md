# discord_bot
A simple custom Discord bot written with Discord.js

Development: 

	Clone the repo

	Run 'sudo npm install' to fetch all dependencies

	Run 'npm run init' to compile the src directory for the first time

	From there you can run 'npm run babel' to run a watcher on the src directory (instead of having to use 'npm run init' every single time)
